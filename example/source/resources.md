        An incident that occurs on a highway or traffic way that is open to the public by right or custom and involved at least one motor vehicle
          in transport. An incident is reportable if it involves injury to or death of any person, or damage to any vehicle to the extent that it
          cannot be driven under its own power in its customary manner without further damage or hazard to the vehicle, other traffic elements, or
          the roadway, and therefore requires towing.
        This crash data does not include non-reportable crashes or near crashes. In addition, crash data may not contain complete information, some
